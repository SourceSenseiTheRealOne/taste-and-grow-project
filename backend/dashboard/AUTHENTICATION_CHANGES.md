# Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete admin authentication system for the Taste & Grow Dashboard.

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. **Authentication Context** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Created global authentication state management
- Handles login/logout operations
- Stores JWT token and user data in localStorage
- Provides authentication state to all components
- Auto-loads saved session on app startup

### 2. **Login Page** (`src/pages/Login.tsx`)
- Beautiful, modern login form with the Taste & Grow branding
- Email and password fields with validation
- Error handling and display
- Loading states during authentication
- Admin role verification (only ADMIN users can login)
- Auto-redirects to dashboard after successful login

### 3. **Protected Routes** (`src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)
- Wrapper component for route protection
- Redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`
- Shows loading spinner during authentication check
- Prevents unauthorized access to dashboard routes

### 4. **Header Component** (`src/components/Header.tsx`)
- Displays in the top-right corner of the dashboard
- Shows admin's name, role, and avatar with initials
- Dropdown menu with:
  - User profile information
  - Profile option (placeholder for future)
  - Logout button
- Responsive design (hides text on small screens)

### 5. **Updated Layout** (`src/components/Layout.tsx`)
- Integrated Header component
- Updated flex layout to accommodate header
- Header is sticky at the top

### 6. **Updated App Router** (`src/App.tsx`)
- Wrapped entire app with `AuthProvider`
- Added `/login` route
- Protected all dashboard routes with `ProtectedRoute`
- Proper route structure for authentication flow

### 7. **Documentation**
- Created `AUTH_SETUP.md` - Complete authentication guide
- Updated `README.md` - Added authentication section
- Updated `VERCEL_ENV_SETUP.md` - Added production auth setup

   - Sent with API requests

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Only ADMIN users can access dashboard
   - Role verification during login

   - Cleared on logout
   - Auto-loaded on app startup

## 🚀 How to Use

### Development
1. Start the API server: `cd backend/api && npm run dev`
2. Start the dashboard: `cd backend/dashboard && npm run dev`
3. Create admin user (see AUTH_SETUP.md)
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/login`
5. Login with admin credentials

### Production
1. Deploy API to your hosting service
2. Deploy dashboard to Vercel
3. Set `VITE_API_URL` environment variable in Vercel
4. Create admin user via production API
5. Navigate to your Vercel URL
6. Login with admin credentials

## 🎯 User Flow

```
1. User visits dashboard → Redirected to /login (if not authenticated)
2. User enters email/password → Click "Login"
3. System validates credentials → Checks for ADMIN role
4. If valid admin → Store token & user data → Redirect to dashboard
5. Dashboard loads → Header shows username & avatar
6. User clicks avatar → Dropdown shows profile & logout
7. User clicks logout → Clear session → Redirect to login
```

## 📋 API Integration

The authentication system integrates with these API endpoints:

- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- Returns user object with role and JWT token
- Dashboard validates ADMIN role client-side

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login with valid admin credentials → Success
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials → Error message
- [ ] Login with non-admin user → "Only administrators" error
- [ ] Access dashboard without login → Redirect to /login
- [ ] Refresh page while logged in → Stay logged in
- [ ] Click logout → Redirect to login & clear session
- [ ] Try to access dashboard after logout → Redirect to login

## 💡 Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Password reset functionality
- "Remember me" option
- Session timeout warnings
- Two-factor authentication
- Admin activity logging
- Multiple admin roles (super admin, moderator, etc.)
- Profile editing page
- Password change functionality

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Can't login
- Check API is running on correct port
- Verify VITE_API_URL in .env file
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify user has ADMIN role in database

### Session not persisting
- Check localStorage is enabled in browser
- Verify token is being stored
- Check browser console for errors

### API connection issues
- Verify API URL is correct
- Check CORS settings in API
- Ensure API is accessible from dashboard URL

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check `AUTH_SETUP.md` for setup instructions
2. Check `README.md` for general dashboard info
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Verify API is running and accessible
